I'm a CompSci Graduate and Cloud Engineer. I love working with the latest Cybersecurity and Cloud technologies, and developing secure apps and systems according to best practices and meet industry standards. 

I always enjoy discussing my interests, anything IT-related, and broadening my technical knowledge as there is always something new to learn!
